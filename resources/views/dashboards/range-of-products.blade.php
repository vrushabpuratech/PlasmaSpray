    <div class="mainheading" id="Tungsten"><h5>Tungsten Carbide Coating</h5></div>
    <div class="textblack14cont">A tough & wear resistant solution i.e. 1100 - 1350 Hv DP300 (70 - 73 HRC approx) .The coatings are applied by HVOF. These find wide applications in industrial components like Bridle rolls, Deflector rolls, Heath Rolls, Rewinder rolls, Capstan, Pulleys, Sleeves.</div> 
        
    <div class="mainheading topmargin30" id="Ceramic"><h5>Ceramic Coating</h5></div>
    <div class="textblack14cont">A chemically inert and wear resistant family of coatings that can be used at temperature upto 1100 Degree C ( use symbol - note for dev). These find applications in Paper industries, Aerospace,Gas Turbines etc. Coatings like Chrome oxide , Aluminium Oxide , Zirconium Oxide are some popular coatings options amongst customers.</div>
        
    <div class="mainheading topmargin30" id="Chrome"><h5>Chrome Oxide Coating</h5></div>
    <div class="textblack14cont">Type of ceramic coating successfully being used in application like seal areas , bearing diameters, aluminium pulleys etc.These find applications in pump industries. Coating had a hardness of around 900 - 1200 Hv DP300. The coating is slightly porous and chemically inert so for lubricated applications it works very well.</div>    
        
    <div class="mainheading topmargin30" id="Stellite"><h5>Stellite Coating</h5></div>
    <div class="textblack14cont">These are used for applications required all round wear, corrosion, temperature protection. These are widely used in the pumps, oil and gas, and steel industries .Part like Ball valves that are stellite welded upto 1.5 to 2mm can now be  are being replaced by Stellite coating by HVOF</div>
