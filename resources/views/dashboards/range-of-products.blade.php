<div class="mainheading" id="Tungsten"><h5>Tungsten Carbide Coating</h5></div>
<div class="textblack14cont">A tough & wear resistant solution i.e. 1100 - 1350 Hv DP300 (70 - 73 HRC approx) .The coatings are applied by HVOF. These find wide applications in industrial components like Bridle rolls, Deflector rolls, Heath Rolls, Rewinder rolls, Capstan, Pulleys, Sleeves.</div> 
    
<div class="mainheading topmargin30" id="Ceramic"><h5>Ceramic Coating</h5></div>
<div class="textblack14cont">A chemically inert and wear resistant family of coatings that can be used at temperature upto 1100 Degree C ( use symbol - note for dev). These find applications in Paper industries, Aerospace,Gas Turbines etc. Coatings like Chrome oxide , Aluminium Oxide , Zirconium Oxide are some popular coatings options amongst customers.</div>
    
<div class="mainheading topmargin30" id="Chrome"><h5>Chrome Oxide Coating</h5></div>
<div class="textblack14cont">Type of ceramic coating successfully being used in application like seal areas , bearing diameters, aluminium pulleys etc.These find applications in pump industries. Coating had a hardness of around 900 - 1200 Hv DP300. The coating is slightly porous and chemically inert so for lubricated applications it works very well.</div>    
    
<div class="mainheading topmargin30" id="Stellite"><h5>Stellite Coating</h5></div>
<div class="textblack14cont">These are used for applications required all round wear, corrosion, temperature protection. These are widely used in the pumps, oil and gas, and steel industries .Part like Ball valves that are stellite welded upto 1.5 to 2mm can now be  are being replaced by Stellite coating by HVOF</div>

<div class="mainheading"><h2>Benefits of coatings</h2></div>    
<div class="textblack14cont">
<ul>
<li>Enhanced functionality for a wide range of base materials like MS, SS, Special Alloys,
Aluminium, Copper, Titanium, etc.</li>   
<li>Compatibility with materials such as Mild Steel, Stainless Steel, Special Alloyed Steel,
Aluminium, Copper, Titanium, etc.</li>   
<li>Selection from a diverse range of coating materials tailored for challenging applications,
including Tungsten Carbide, Chrome Carbide, Chrome Oxide, Aluminium Oxide, Yittria
Stabilised Zirconia, SS 304, SS 316, etc.</li>   
<li>Ability to apply coatings selectively to specific areas of part geometries, ideal for
repairing local areas like bearing diameters, impeller shafts, rotors, and housings.</li>   
<li>Capability to coat complex shapes and geometries with high repeatability and achieve
precise dimensional accuracies through post-grinding.</li>   
<li>Attainment of desired hardness levels ranging from 28 HRC up to 72 HRC.</li>   
<li>Achievable surface roughness options including 10-12 Ra, 8-10 Ra, 4-6 Ra, 3-5 Ra, 1.6-
3.2 Ra, 0.1-0.8 Ra, 0.04-0.06 Ra, etc.</li>
